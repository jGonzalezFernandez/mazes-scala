  /* Hereâ€™s the mile-high view of recursive backtracking:
   * 1. Choose a starting point in the field.
   * 2. Randomly choose a wall at that point and carve a passage through to the adjacent cell, but only if the adjacent
   *    cell has not been visited yet. This becomes the new current cell.
   * 3. If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to the last cell that has uncarved walls and repeat.
   * 4. The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the starting point.
